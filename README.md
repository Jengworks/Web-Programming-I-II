# Web Programming I & II

Below are some of the screenshots of my work done in this two-part web programming series

* A form for users that want to register
* Registered information will be stored in a SQL database in backend

**Admin Site**
  * After logging in, if the account is admin, then display the admin site consisting of:
  * A table representing the SQL database
  * Four database CRUD actions
  * A function to export the data to csv
